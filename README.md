# LateLogins
An app that will house a persons login and passwords for accounts they have after they pass, that contains the information the family would want that would help in a sad time, like a PGP key it would contain the private key thats placed somewhere by the person in life, and public key, the app would require both to access.

This isn't a perfect layout but it's initally such that:

##############
Family Member    ----------||| Accounts |||------------Information Storage for Accounts----Processed ----->>  [Private Key]
#############

####################
Other Family Members ----------Enter Family Members Private Key ------ Processed ---->> [Public Key] is generated.
####################

If something happens then it will have been up to the family member who wanted to convey that information to have in some manner distributed that private key to a person of trust, external media (i.e. usb, memory card, stored it online somewhere) -- at that point, the app, all localized, unless person uses back up providers.

The private key is found and used to authenticate the public keys and the information is presented to the family members remaining, that would grant access to FB accounts, Google, Journals, etc...
